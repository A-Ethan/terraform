# What’s New in the Second Edition
The first edition of this book came out in 2017; I’m now writing the second edition in May 2019, and it’s remarkable how much has changed in just a couple years! The second edition is almost double the length of the first edition (roughly 160 more pages), including two completely new chapters,and major updates to all the original chapters and code examples.

If you read the first edition of the book and want to know what’s new, or if you’re just curious to see how Terraform has evolved, here are some of the highlights:
Four major Terraform releases Terraform was at version 0.8 when this book first came out; between then and the time of this second edition, Terraform has had four major releases, and is now at version 0.12. These releases introduced some amazing new functionality, as described next, as well as a fair amount of upgrade work for users!

## Automated testing improvements
The tooling and practices for writing automated tests for Terraform code have evolved considerably. Chapter 7 is a completely new chapter dedicated to testing, covering topics such as unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, dependency injection, test parallelism, static analysis, and more.

## Module improvements
The tooling and practices for creating Terraform modules have also evolved considerably. In the brand new Chapter 6, you’ll find a guide to building reusable, battle-tested, production-grade Terraform modules—the kind of modules you’d bet your company on.

## Workflow improvements
Chapter 8 has been completely rewritten to reflect the changes in how teams integrate Terraform into their workflow, including a detailed guide on how to take application code and infrastructure code from development through testing and all the way to production.

## HCL2
Terraform 0.12 overhauled the underlying language from HCL to HCL2. This included support for first-class expressions (so that you don’t need to wrap everything with ${…}!), rich type constraints, lazily evaluated conditional expressions, support for null, for_each and for expressions, dynamic inline blocks, and more. All the code examples in this book have been updated to use HCL2, and the new language features are covered extensively in Chapters 5 and 6.

## Terraform state revamp
Terraform 0.9 introduced backends as a first-class way to store and share Terraform state, including built-in support for locking. Terraform 0.9 also introduced state environments as a way to manage deployments across multiple environments. In Terraform 0.10, state environments were replaced with Terraform workspaces. I cover all of these topics in Chapter 3.
## Terraform providers split
In Terraform 0.10, the core Terraform code was split up from the code for all the providers (i.e., the code for AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). This allowed providers to be developed in their own repositories, at their own cadence, with their own versioning. However, you now must run terraform init to download the provider code every time you start working with a new module, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 7.
## Massive provider growth
Since 2016, Terraform has grown from a handful of major cloud providers (the usual suspects, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure) to more than 100 official providers and many more community providers. This means that you can now use Terraform to not only manage many other types of clouds (e.g., there are now providers for Alicloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, VMware vSphere, and others), but also to manage many other aspects of your world as code, including version control systems, such as the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket providers; data stores like MySQL, PostreSQL, or InfluxDB providers; monitoring and alerting systems, including DataDog, New Relic, or Grafana providers;platform tools such as Kubernetes, Helm, Heroku, Rundeck, or Rightscale providers; and much more. Moreover, each provider has much better coverage these days: AWS now covers the majority of important AWS services and often adds support for new services even before CloudFormation!
## Terraform Registry
HashiCorp launched the Terraform Registry in 2017, a UI that made it easy to browse and consume open source, reusable Terraform modules contributed by the community. In 2018, HashiCorp added the ability to run a Private Terraform Registry within your own organization.Terraform 0.11 added first-class syntax support for consuming modules from a Terraform Registry. We look at the Registry in “Releasable modules”.
## Better error handling
Terraform 0.9 updated state error handling: if there was an error writing state to a remote backend, the state would be saved locally in an errored.tfstate file. Terraform 0.12 completely overhauled error handling, by catching errors earlier, showing clearer error messages, and including the file path, line number, and a code snippet in the error
message.
## Many other small changes
There were many other smaller changes along the way, including the introduction of local values (“Module Locals”), new “escape hatches” for having Terraform interact with the outside world via scripts (e.g.,“Beyond Terraform Modules”), running plan as part of the apply command (“Deploy a Single Server”), fixes for the create_before_destroy cycle issues, major improvements to the count parameter so that it can now include references to data sources and resources (“Loops”), dozens of new built-in functions, an overhaul in provider inheritance, and much more.
